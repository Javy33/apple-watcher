# Apple Pickup Watcher

Use `apw` for inventory queries. It runs without the desktop application and emits JSON. It does not add to a bag, place orders, or send notifications itself.

## Locate and discover

Use `apw --version` and `apw schema` to identify the installed interface. If `apw` is absent, use an explicitly supplied executable path; in a source checkout the build is `cargo build --release --locked -p apw-cli` and the executable is `target/release/apw` (`apw.exe` on Windows). If neither binary nor source checkout is available, explain that the CLI must be installed; do not invent a download URL.

`apw schema` returns the supported flags, exit codes, limits and JSON Schema definitions. This skill covers `schemaVersion: 1`; inspect a different version's contract before relying on field names.

Resolve the user's request through the catalog:

```bash
apw regions
apw stores --locale zh_CN --search 上海
apw products --locale zh_CN --category iphone --search '512GB'
```

Use the returned `locale`, store `number`, and product `partNumber`. A store name or product family is not an identifier. If several variants fit and the user has not requested all of them, clarify the relevant capacity/color/model or store choice. Do not treat the example identifiers below as the user's selection.

Catalog commands use embedded snapshots by default; they are not live stock checks. When current models are needed, use `apw products --locale zh_CN --category iphone --refresh --timeout 120`. An incomplete refresh exits 3 and includes `warning` and fallback data; describe the data as incomplete. Refreshed data lives only in that invocation, but its returned SKUs can be passed to `check` directly.

## Query or watch

```bash
apw check --locale zh_CN --store R359 --part 'MWUC3CH/A' --timeout 60
apw watch --locale zh_CN --store R359 --part 'MWUC3CH/A' \
  --interval 30 --until-in-stock --timeout 300
```

`check` completes one cycle. For explicit target pairs or multiple regions, use a JSON array with `--targets FILE` or `--targets -` (stdin):

```json
[
  {"locale":"zh_CN","storeNumber":"R359","partNumber":"MWUC3CH/A"}
]
```

Up to 256 targets / 1 MiB are accepted. Repeated `--store` and `--part` flags query every store/part combination; use the JSON array when only particular pairs are intended. `--targets` is exclusive with those flags and `--locale`.

Apple Watch entries in `apw products` carry a `companionPart` (a band part number from the same buy page). Apple's pickup endpoint only answers truthfully for a watch case when a band is in the same query, so `check` and `watch` add it automatically for SKUs found in the embedded catalog. When a watch SKU came from `--refresh` output, pass its `companionPart` in the targets JSON (`{"locale":…,"storeNumber":…,"partNumber":…,"companionPart":…}`); a watch case queried without a band may come back empty or as a false negative.

Prefer one bounded `watch` process for repeated checks so the engine can share connections, apply backoff, and deduplicate arrival events. Never loop `check` as a substitute: Apple limits pickup queries per egress IP (about 30 back-to-back requests trigger HTTP 541 for ten to fifteen minutes), and only a single `watch` process can keep the request budget. The engine merges same-city stores into one request and paces cycles against that budget; the default interval is 30 seconds (minimum 5) but the real interval grows when the budget runs low (`cycleComplete.paced` is true and `nextCheckInSecs` says how long). Keep the host tool's execution deadline longer than the CLI's deadline. An unlimited `--timeout 0` watch requires a host that can retain the process and a user request for ongoing monitoring. Ending a foreground command or receiving a timeout ends monitoring; do not claim it will continue or notify later.

## Interpret results

- `check.snapshot[]` contains the target, `availability`, `lastCheckedMs` (Unix milliseconds), and consecutive failure count. `anyInStock` means at least one target is confirmed; `healthy` means every target has a known result.
- `availability.kind`: `in_stock` confirms pickup availability; `out_of_stock` is a confirmed negative. `unknown` must retain its `reason` and relevant detail. `not_yet_checked` means pending. A timeout or missing result is not evidence of no stock.
- `watch` emits one JSON object per line; the event is under `event`. `inStock` is an arrival notification; `cycleComplete.snapshot` is the complete cycle view. Continuous stock is not repeatedly announced. `--until-in-stock` exits on **any** target's first confirmed arrival; it does not wait for all targets.
- Exit 0 means a successful query (including no stock), or a satisfied watch condition. Exit 3 means unknown stock or incomplete refresh; parse stdout even on this exit, because other rows may be known. Exit 4 means the overall deadline elapsed; earlier events are historical observations. Exit 2 is invalid input, 1 is an internal/I/O error, 130/143 is interruption, and 141 means the output consumer closed its pipe.
- stdout contains JSON/NDJSON; stderr contains structured fatal errors. `--help` and `--version` are text exceptions. Do not hide nonzero exits with `|| true`, discard partial stdout, or translate request errors into no stock.

Report the exact region/store/model, observation time, and any unknown or incomplete result. A fresh successful check demonstrates this invocation's result, not reliability on every network. HTTP 541 should be reported as blocked; avoid rapid retries or concurrent duplicate watchers. After a block the client cools down for minutes and reports `unknown / blocked` with the remaining time; do not start a second process to work around it. When the user wants to diagnose recurring 541, run `apw doctor --locale … --store … --part …` (paced, never retried, prints a redacted Markdown report) and hand them the report. Let the user's requested workflow determine whether an arrival is simply reported or passed to an already authorized notification channel.
